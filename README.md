What is QbaoChain?
-------------

QbaoChain is a kind of Consortium Blockchain. Every node involved in the Blockchain system is licensed. Unlicensed nodes cannot be connected to the system. The affiliate chain is a Blockchain that requires registration, also known as the Permissioned Blockchain.

QbaoChain not only perfectly realizes the characteristics of the blockchain that can not be tampered, forged, denied, distributed, no trust, point-to-point, collective maintenance, etc. QbaoChain is designed from the overall architecture to node coding development. From consensus algorithms to object storage; From encryption algorithms to broadcast strategies; From performance tuning to QbaoChain, there are huge innovations and breakthroughs. Therefore, QbaoChain has more obvious advantages over the original public chain.

Powerful Functionality
Adopting the UTXO account model of BTC, which supports the simultaneous processing of multiple UTXO, is therefore highly scalable, enabling parallel transactions and encouraging scalability innovations. Also, if a user USES a new address for each transaction, UTXO can provide powerful anonymity to prevent it from being tracked. In addition to this, QbaoChain also supports a strong contract layer, a smart contract is a set of conventions defined in digital form, including those on which the contract participants can enforce them. Because of the immutable and distributed nature of blockchain, smart contracts, once created, can never be changed and can therefore solve trust issues.

Lightning Speed
BTC trade at the rate of 3 per second, ETH speed is 6.7 per second, IBM's books theoretical peak is 200 transactions per second, by redesigning our consensus mechanism, separation of consensus steps, to discuss first, greatly improve the performance of the block chain network, in QbaoChain QbaoChain trading speed can reach 5000 transactions per second, as the future network bandwidth upgrade, further improve speed.

Higher Safety
The information on the coalition chain is not accessible to all, and only the nodes on the alliance chain can be accessed, thus providing high-level security. It not only has the privacy of the private chain, but also has the decentralization thinking of the public chain, which ensures the high privacy of data on the chain and avoids the occurrence of attacks on nodes.

Ultralight Storage
BTC blockchain requires huge storage space of tens of gigabytes, some even larger, which requires nodes to provide proprietary large-capacity storage devices, and in QbaoChain, the space required for QbaoChain will shrink by about 100 times, or even less. Because it only needs to store the data after blockchain hash and key checkpoints, the storage space is reduced directly to a dozen M or even several M.

A Truly Private Wallet
BTC/ETH kind of wallet must with the help of a centralized server, often stolen events, QbaoChain provide real private decentralized purse, wallet to store in the center of the third party no longer on the server, but rather direct access to the block chain nodes, and better protect the private key, my wallet is no longer as third-party credit problems, safety problems lead to lost wallet, has realized the real can't steal block chain private purses.
